        send_lock: Used to guarantee thread-safety when sending RPC responses.

        client_locks: A dict mapping client ids to locks used by those clients.

        passthru_subscriptions: When we recieve a subscription request for a
            service method registered on a remote service, we pass that request
            along to the remote service and send back the responses.  This
            dictionary maps client ids to those subscription objects.

            user who made the incoming websocket connection; by default we only
            copy the username, but this can be overridden in configuration.
            Remember that Sideboard exposes two websocket handlers at /ws and
            /wsrpc, with /ws being auth-protected (so the username field will be
            meaningful) and /wsrpc being client-cert protected (so the username
            will always be 'rpc').

        header_fields: We copy header fields from the request that initiated the
            websocket connection.

        cached_queries and cached_fingerprints: When we receive a subscription
            update, Sideboard re-runs all of the subscription methods to see if
            new data needs to be pushed out.  We do this by storing all of the
            rpc methods and an MD5 hash of their return values.  We store a hash
            rather than the return values themselves to save on memory, since
            return values may be very large.
